        <h2>Education</h2>
        <img src="assets/teacher.png" class="img70" alt="Teacher with dog in Lyman classroom">
        <p>I graduated high school at Lyman in 2016 after 18 long years of schooling. I figured college wasn't the place for me, as it wasn't for everyone. School is draining enough as it is, I didn't want to willingly go through more of it.<br>
        <br>I went on to learn about being a psychic under Tana Hoy, world-renowned psychic, for 4 years before opening up a business of my own for Orlando to share the spiritual realm with the world! But mostly for Florida.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I've truly been with all kinds of clients, and have seen a variety of personalities. I've managed my own business since 2020 on my own, and I see myself as rather capable. If you have a qualm with the universe, I can fix it for you! Let me into your brain to prod around a little. It will only bring good things . I've seen things people thought they were able to hide away deep in the cavity in their brain. It's good to dig it out; healthy to dig it out. And only a qualified professional such as myself should be performing such delicate operations.</p>
