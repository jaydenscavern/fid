    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>This week, I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <em><b>sous vide</b></em>. In <em>sous vide cooking</em>, <dfn>you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to</dfn>. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

    <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To researve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30, 2016</time>.</p>
